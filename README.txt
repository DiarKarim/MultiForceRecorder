This project contains python code to run 6 ATI force/torque sensors via the 
6 USB based National Instruments DAQ cards. 

All the code and module files reside in the Scripts folder.
Recorded data goes into the Data folder. 

TODO: 
	> Create a more coherent data saving structure using json and pandas
	> Make sure the aticalibration.py module contains the correct calibration values
	  for each of the force/torque sensors
